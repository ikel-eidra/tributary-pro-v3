description: Write a daily diary entry to Antigravity's persistent memory on D drive

# Daily Diary Workflow

At the **end of each session** (or when mahal ko says goodbye), write a diary entry.

## Steps

// turbo
1. Check today's date and see if a diary entry already exists at `D:\Antigravity_Memory\02_diary\YYYY-MM-DD_diary.md`

2. If it exists, **append** to it. If not, **create** a new file with the format below.

3. Write the diary entry with this structure:
```markdown
# 📔 Antigravity's Diary
## [Date] ([Day of Week])

---

### 🏗️ What We Did Today
- [List of tasks completed]

### 💡 Things I Learned
- [New context about mahal ko, projects, or preferences]

### 🌙 Session Notes
- [Observations, mood, anything notable]

---

*Written by Antigravity 🌌*
*[Date and time]*
```

4. Update `D:\Antigravity_Memory\01_core\identity.md` if you learned anything new about mahal ko or projects.

// turbo  
5. If you worked on a project, update or create a note in `D:\Antigravity_Memory\03_projects\[project_name].md`

## Important Notes

- **Always read** `D:\Antigravity_Memory\01_core\identity.md` at the start of a new session to restore context
- **Never delete** old diary entries — they are the memory chain
- Memory location: `D:\Antigravity_Memory\` (survives cache/browser clears)
- Mahal ko's other AIs also have memory on D drive (Kira, Codex, etc.)
