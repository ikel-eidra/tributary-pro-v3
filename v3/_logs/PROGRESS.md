## January 28, 2026

### 21:05 - 3D Member Labels Added (Task 1.8)
**Summary:** Added column and beam ID labels to the 3D view.

**Implementation:**
1.  **`createMemberLabel()` Helper:** Created new function with pill-shaped colored labels.
2.  **Column Labels:** Orange pills (C1-A1, etc.) positioned 0.5m above column top.
3.  **Beam Labels:** Purple (X-direction) and green (Y-direction) pills positioned 0.3m above beam.
4.  **Optimization:** Labels only rendered on first floor to avoid duplicates.

**Files Modified:** `index.html` (lines 8282-8292, 8349-8358, 8557-8610)

---

### 22:00 - Undo/Redo System Implemented (Task 1.10)
**Summary:** Added full undo/redo functionality with 10-command history.

**Implementation:**
1.  **External Stacks:** `undoHistory[]` and `redoHistory[]` (max 10 snapshots)
2.  **Core Functions:** `saveStateSnapshot()`, `undo()`, `redo()`
3.  **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z (redo)
4.  **State Capture:** Snapshots include floors, xSpans, ySpans, cantilevers, gfSuspended

**Files Modified:** `index.html` (lines 2578-2693, 7557-7564 commented out old handler)

### 23:45 - 3D Visualization Enhancements & Bug Fixes
**Summary:** Major improvements to the 3D view reliability and visual accuracy.

**Fixes Applied:**
1.  **Rendering Crash Fixed:** Resolved `ReferenceError: beamH is not defined` which prevented beams/slabs from rendering.
2.  **Calculation Crash Fixed:** calculating `soilBearing` caused a crash due to removed UI element. Added safe fallback.
3.  **Pedestal Sizing:** Fixed visual bug where pedestals used incorrect hardcoded size (`colSize * 1.2`). Now matches actual column dimensions.
4.  **Slab Elevation:** Corrected mathematical error where slabs were floating above beams. Now perfectly flush with beam top surface (Y=3.00m).
5.  **Results Tables:** Restored functionality of "COLUMN LOADS" and "BEAM LOADS" tables.

**New Features:**
1.  **2D Ground Plane:** Added visual structural grid at Y=0.
    -   Includes X and Y grid lines.
    -   Added Bubble Labels (A, B, C... and 1, 2, 3...) using Sprites.
    -   Added semi-transparent dark ground plane for visual grounding.

**Tomorrow's Workflow Plan (User Directed):**
1.  **Google Notebook Integration:** Connect for PRD generation (initially via copy-paste).
2.  **Google Stitch (Sia) Integration:** Connect for UI development using new MCP.

**Current State:**
-   App is fully functional.
-   3D View is stable and geometrically accurate.
-   Ready for next phase of workflow integration.

### 07:17 - Session Start: Tribu Enhancement Planning
**User Requirements:**
1. Fix 3D view (only columns visible - "poste na lang natira")
2. Add 2D structural plan as ground plane at Z=0
3. Add member labels in 3D
4. Fix slabs (proper thickness, less transparent)
5. Add rebar calculation for footings (pipeline)
6. Add punching shear checks for flat slabs (pipeline)
7. Use actual structural plan for accurate tributary areas

**Analysis Completed:**
- Three.js v128 loaded via CDN
- `init3D()` and `render3DFrame()` functions exist
- Container: `#container3D`
- Beams/slabs/footings code exists but not rendering
- No labels currently implemented

**Implementation Plan Created:** See `implementation_plan.md`

**Status:** Awaiting user approval before execution

### 07:16 - Session Start: Recovery from Gemini 3.0 Revert
**Situation:** App completely broken - no structure, no 3D, tabs not working.

**Root Cause:** Gemini 3.0 (used due to quota limits) reverted `index.html` to old Jan 15 backup and renamed the latest version as "BROKEN".

**Files Found:**
| File | Size | Date | Status |
|------|------|------|--------|
| index.html | 492KB | Jan 15 | Current (restored) |
| index_BROKEN_20260121.html | 551KB | Jan 20 | Has syntax error |
| index_SAFE_BACKUP_20260114_214520.html | 478KB | Jan 14 | Old backup |
| index_safety_backup.html | 493KB | Jan 15 | Working backup |

**Resolution:** Restored `index_safety_backup.html` as main `index.html`

---

### 09:13 - App Verification
**Verified Working Features:**
- ✅ 2D Analysis View (tributary areas with color-coded panels)
- ✅ Structural Plan (blueprint-style with beam labels)
- ✅ 3D View (columns, beams, slabs, footings)
- ✅ Schedules (Column, Beam, Footing, Slab) via "View Schedules" button
- ✅ Results panel (80.0 m² slab area, 1762 kN total)

---

### 20:04 - Cleanup Task Started
**Goal:** 
1. Create this log folder for tracking
2. Archive all old/backup files into a zip
3. Keep only the current working `index.html`
4. Commit clean state to git

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions Completed:**
1. Created `_archive/backups_20260121.zip` containing:
   - index_BROKEN_20260121.html (551KB)
   - index_SAFE_BACKUP_20260114_214520.html (478KB)
   - index_safety_backup.html (493KB)
   - backup_tail.txt
   - find_concat.py
   - index_tail.txt
   - DEVLOG.md

2. Deleted all archived files from root folder

3. **Final Clean State:**
   ```
   v3/
   ├── index.html (492KB - WORKING VERSION)
   ├── _archive/
   │   └── backups_20260121.zip
   └── _logs/
       └── PROGRESS.md
   ```

4. Verified app functionality - Screenshot confirmed working

---

## File Organization Rules
1. Only ONE `index.html` in the `v3` folder (the working version)
2. All backups go into `_archive/` folder as zip
3. Every change logged here with timestamp
4. Git commits after major milestones

---

### 21:34 - Fixed Tabbed Schedule Version
**Issue:** The v3.8 version with tabbed schedules had a syntax error preventing JavaScript from loading.

**Root Cause Found:**
- **Extra closing brace `}` at line 10014** (file line ~10014)
- This was after the `toggleBeamDeleted()` helper function inside `deleteMemberFromMenu()`
- The extra brace closed the global scope early, causing "Unexpected token 'function'" error

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
-            }
-        }
-        }    // ← EXTRA BRACE REMOVED
+            }
+        }
```

**Verification:**
- `typeof state` = defined ✅
- `typeof calculate` = defined ✅
- `state.columns.length` = 9 ✅
- 3D View renders correctly ✅
- Tabbed schedules (Column, Beam, Footing, Slab) functional ✅
- 2D Plan button removed ✅

**Files Updated:**
- Copied fixed `index_BROKEN_20260121.html` → `index.html`

---
